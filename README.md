# Cervical_Cancer_Causal_Analysis
In the past decade, cervical cancer has been a really serious public health issue. According to WHO, almost all cervical cancer cases (99%) are linked to infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), an extremely common virus transmitted through sexual contact. Hence, in this project, I want to find the STD(Sexual Transmitted Disease) related and sexual behavior related causing factors of the cervical cancer.  

The dataset used in this project is a public dataset from UCI. In addition, the EDA part is done, using Tableau. The links to the data source and the dashboard are attached below. If you have any questions about my projects, feel free to contact me via my Linkedin.
